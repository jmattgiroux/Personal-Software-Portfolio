About:

The directions for this course instructed us to create a public repository for this course's work.

Prior classes have forbidden this practice due to worries about plagiarism and cheating.
So, I am including a link to the relevant instructions, here:
    https://byui_cse.github.io/cse310-course/lesson01/01-prove.html

If you are a student of CS 246 or CS 310,
please do not use the code within this repository.
As it stated in the link above,

    "It is an Honor Code violation to obtain previously developed solutions
    from others, including using internet sites that share course work
    previously submitted by other students."
