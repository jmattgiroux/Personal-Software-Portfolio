This is a simple program that prints

to the console.

Program Environment
This program was created on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS, on a 64-bit computer.
This environment has compilers installed, through the command

sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you don't run this command before you start programming the first
time on your system, you're going to have a bad time.


This program was created using CLion, an IDE created by the company JetBrains.
It is programmed in C++, and was compiled in the 
Linux terminal with the command

g++ main.cpp

Then, you can run the program through the terminal with the command

./a.out
